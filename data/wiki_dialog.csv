10073@21,,,Epicurus,"Q: What caused the failure and decay of Epicureanism?
A: Epicureanism also suffered decay in the wake of Christianity, which was also rapidly expanding throughout the Roman Empire.
Q: How did it decline?
A: Of all the Greek philosophical schools, Epicureanism was the one most at odds with the new Christian teachings, since Epicureans believed that the soul was mortal, denied the existence of an afterlife, denied that the divine had any active role in human life, and advocated pleasure as the foremost goal of human existence.
Q: Did people think these views were incorrect?
A: As such, Christian writers such as Justin Martyr ( 100– 165 AD), Athenagoras of Athens ( 133– 190), Tertullian ( 155– 240), and Clement of Alexandria ( 150– 215), Arnobius (died 330), and Lactantius all singled it out for the most vitriolic criticism.
Q: Did people agree with the criticisms?
A: In spite of this, DeWitt argues that Epicureanism and Christianity share much common language, calling Epicureanism ""the first missionary philosophy"" and ""the first world philosophy"".
Q: What did Epicureanism and Christianity have in common?
A: Both Epicureanism and Christianity placed strong emphasis on the importance of love and forgiveness and early Christian portrayals of Jesus are often similar to Epicurean portrayals of Epicurus.
Q: Did Epicureanism and Christianity have other similarities?
A: DeWitt argues that Epicureanism, in many ways, helped pave the way for the spread of Christianity by ""helping to bridge the gap between Greek intellectualism and a religious way of life"" and ""shunt[ing] the emphasis from the political to the social virtues and offer[ing] what may be called a religion of humanity."" By the early fifth century AD, Epicureanism was virtually extinct."

Q: OH- or OH-?
A: ONOO) to attenuate the mobilization of NFκB and AP-1 transcription factors by reducing their accumulation in the nucleus of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes; NFκB and AP-1 increase expression of pro-inflammatory genes.
Q: Any other interesting information about Lipoxin?
A: The two LXBs also trigger activation of Suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins (see SOCS proteins) which, in turn, inhibit activation of STAT protein transcription factors which up-regulate many genes making pro-inflammatory products.
Q: What is the most interesting information about Lipoxin?
A: LXA and 15-epi-LXA are also high affinity antagonists of the Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 for which leukotrienes (LT) LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 are agonists, i.e. the three leukotrienes bind to and thereby stimulate smooth muscle contraction, eosinophil chemotactaxis, mucous gland secretion, and various other pro-allergic responses in the cells of lung, skin, and other tissues.
Q: What is the most interesting information about Lipoxin?
A: (CysLT1 and ATX/FPR2 have an amino acid sequence identity of 47%.)
Q: What is the most interesting information about Lipoxin?
A: The ability of these LXs to block the actions of the three LTs may contribute to their ability to resolve allergic reactions; for example, LXA4 relaxes the smooth muscle contraction caused by the cysteinyl leukotrienes in the hamster cheek pouch assay and a metabolically resistant 15-epi-LXAA analog potently inhibits allergen-driven airway hypersensitivity and inflammation in a mouse model."

10172238@1,,,Nanofluidics,"Q: What are some of the advantages of using mesoporous materials?
A: For example, the drastically enhanced surface-to-volume ratio of the pore results in a preponderance of counter-ions (""i.e."" ions charged oppositely to the static wall charges) over co-ions (possessing the same sign as the wall charges), in many cases to the near-complete exclusion of co-ions, such that only one ionic species exists in the pore.
Q: How is this beneficial?
A: This can be used for manipulation of species with selective polarity along the pore length to achieve unusual fluidic manipulation schemes not possible in micrometer and larger structures.
Q: What other benefits are there?
A: In 1965, Rice and Whitehead published the seminal contribution to the theory of the transport of electrolyte solutions in long (ideally infinite) nanometer-diameter capillaries.
Q: What was this contribution?
A: Briefly, the potential, ""ϕ"", at a radial distance, ""r"", is given by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation,  where ""κ"" is the inverse Debye length, determined by the ion number density, ""n"", the dielectric constant, ""ε"", the Boltzmann constant, ""k"", and the temperature, ""T"".
Q: What else is important?
A: Knowing the potential, ""φ(r)"", the charge density can then be recovered from the Poisson equation, whose solution may be expressed as a modified Bessel function of the first kind, ""I"", and scaled to the capillary radius, ""a"".
Q: What else is significant about this?
A: An equation of motion under combined pressure and electrically-driven flow can then be written,  where ""η"" is the viscosity, ""dp/dz"" is the pressure gradient, and ""F"" is the body force driven by the action of the applied electric field, ""E"", on the net charge density in the double layer."

1020643@2,,,Hydrophobic effect,"Q: What does the hydrophobic effect mean?
A: The hydrogen bonds are reoriented tangentially to such surface to minimize disruption of the hydrogen bonded 3D network of water molecules, and this leads to a structured water ""cage"" around the nonpolar surface.
Q: Does this lead to the water being trapped?
A: The water molecules that form the ""cage"" (or clathrate) have restricted mobility.
Q: How much is their mobility restricted?
A: In the solvation shell of small nonpolar particles, the restriction amounts to some 10%.
Q: Does it change with temperature?
A: For example, in the case of dissolved xenon at room temperature a mobility restriction of 30% has been found.
Q: Is there any other interesting information about this?
A: In the case of larger nonpolar molecules, the reorientational and translational motion of the water molecules in the solvation shell may be restricted by a factor of two to four; thus, at 25 °C the reorientational correlation time of water increases from 2 to 4-8 picoseconds.
Q: What does this mean for the water?
A: Generally, this leads to significant losses in translational and rotational entropy of water molecules and makes the process unfavorable in terms of the free energy in the system."

A: Gravity model of migration The gravity model of migration is a model in urban geography derived from Newton's law of gravity, and used to predict the degree of migration interaction between two places.
Q: How is it derived from Newton's law of gravity?
A: Newton's law states that: ""Any two bodies attract one another with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."" When used geographically, the words 'bodies' and 'masses' are replaced by 'locations' and 'importance' respectively, where importance can be measured in terms of population numbers, gross domestic product, or other appropriate variables.
Q: What else is it based on?
A: The gravity model of migration is therefore based upon the idea that as the importance of one or both of the location increases, there will also be an increase in movement between them.
Q: What else is it based on?
A: The farther apart the two locations are, however, the movement between them will be less.
Q: What is the distance decay?
A: This phenomenon is known as distance decay.

1020643@1,,,Hydrophobic effect,"Q: What is the Hydrophobic effect in relation to protein folding?
A: In the case of protein folding, the hydrophobic effect is important to understanding the structure of proteins that have hydrophobic amino acids (such as glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine) clustered together within the protein.
Q: How is this important?
A: Structures of water-soluble proteins have a hydrophobic core in which side chains are buried from water, which stabilizes the folded state.
Q: What is the Hydrophobic core?
A: Charged and polar side chains are situated on the solvent-exposed surface where they interact with surrounding water molecules.
Q: Is this an important concept in protein folding?
A: Minimizing the number of hydrophobic side chains exposed to water is the principal driving force behind the folding process, The energetics of DNA tertiary structure assembly were determined to be driven by the hydrophobic effect, in addition to Watson-Crick base pairing, which is responsible for sequence selectivity, and stacking interactions between the aromatic bases.
Q: Is there anything else important about the Hydrophobic effect in relation to protein folding?
A: In biochemistry, the hydrophobic effect can be used to separate mixtures of proteins based on their hydrophobicity.
Q: How is this done?

10004409@0,,,Shear strength (soil),"Q: What is shear strength?
A: Shear strength (soil) Shear strength is a term used in soil mechanics to describe the magnitude of the shear stress that a soil can sustain.
Q: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?
A: The shear resistance of soil is a result of friction and interlocking of particles, and possibly cementation or bonding at particle contacts.
Q: What is shear resistance?
A: Due to interlocking, particulate material may expand or contract in volume as it is subject to shear strains.
Q: Does it expand or contract?
A: If soil expands its volume, the density of particles will decrease and the strength will decrease; in this case, the peak strength would be followed by a reduction of shear stress.
Q: Does it happen the other way too?
A: The stress-strain relationship levels off when the material stops expanding or contracting, and when interparticle bonds are broken.
Q: What does the stress-strain relationship look like?
A: The theoretical state at which the shear stress and density remain constant while the shear strain increases may be called the critical state, steady state, or residual strength."

10012635@8,,,Lucky McDaniel,"Q: How would McDaniel, a non-expert in ballistics, teach a beginner how to shoot properly using a bb gun?
A: McDaniel would swiftly teach the student's subconscious mind to solve those guidance problems and then use those solutions to direct the muscles to aim and shoot the BB gun simply by having the student shoot the BB gun at the target and observe the results, and then compensate for his miss on the next shot.
Q: What would McDaniel teach the student to do, specifically?
A: Several critically important factors were involved in that process.
Q: What are some examples of these factors?
A: The key factor here was that the student was not expected to hit the target and was instead told to bracket it: to stare at the target, note how far and in which direction his BB missed it, and to believe that with his next shot he was going to miss the target by the same distance but in the opposite direction.
Q: What would the student be doing as he shot?
A: If he did that faithfully, he would soon end up hitting the target regularly.
Q: Why was the student not expected to hit the target?
A: There were two reasons for that; first, this procedure was one of the basic means for training the subconscious very swiftly to solve the guidance-and-control problems; second, it removed the fear of failure from the equation, making the student no longer feel pressured to hit the target each time.

Q: Was it possible to disarm these bombs?
A: As with more modern cluster bombs, it was not considered practical to disarm butterfly bombs which had fully armed themselves but failed to detonate.
Q: Why was it not considered practical?
A: This was because SD 2 fuzes were deliberately designed to be extremely difficult and dangerous to render safe once they had armed themselves.
Q: What was the alternative to disarming them?
A: Instead, the standard render safe procedure for any unexploded SD 2 butterfly bomb was to evacuate the area for at least 30 minutes (in case the bomblet was fitted with a type 67 time delay fuze), then surround it with a ring of sandbags (to contain the explosion) and destroy it ""in situ"" by detonating a small explosive charge beside it.
Q: Did the British use any other means to render them safe?
A: Other solutions were to attach a long string to the bomb and tug on it after taking cover, or for bombs in open countryside, shooting at them with a rifle from a safe distance.
Q: Did the bombs always have their wings attached?
A: Not all unexploded SD 2 butterfly bombs still have their wings attached."

Q: What is securitized collateral?
A: Mass redemptions from these funds after Lehman's failure froze short-term funding for big firms. "" Securitization – the bundling of bank loans to create tradeable bonds – started in the mortgage industry in the 1970s, when Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) began to pool relatively safe, conventional, ""conforming"" or ""prime"" mortgages, create ""mortgage-backed securities"" (MBS) from the pool, sell them to investors, guaranteeing these securities/bonds against default on the underlying mortgages.
Q: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?

10069214@5,,,Battle in Berlin,"Q: What was special about the Soviet armored units during the Battle in Berlin?
A: The Soviets also mounted sub-machine gunners on the tanks who sprayed every doorway and window, but this meant the tank could not traverse its turret quickly.
Q: How were they able to hold the line against enemy armored units?
A: Another solution was to rely on heavy howitzers (152 mm and 203 mm) firing over open sights to blast defended buildings and to use anti-aircraft guns against the German gunners on the higher floors.
Q: Did they use any other tactics during the battle?
A: Soviet combat groups started to move from house to house instead of directly down the streets.
Q: What were some of the weapons they used?

Q: Are there other examples of this process?
A: A few more have consonants switched for unknown reasons, as for example ""Tausret"" becoming ""Thouoris"" (XIX.6 Twosre/Tausret).
Q: What else is interesting about the way in which Egyptian names were reflected in the biblical record?
A: One puzzle is in the conflicting names of some early dynastic kings— though they did not have all five titles, they still had multiple names.
Q: What are the names of the kings whose names are reflected in the biblical record?
A: I.3/4 Djer, whose Son of Ra name is ""Itti"" is considered the basis for the author's I.2 Athothis. I.4 Oenephes then is a puzzle unless it is compared with Djer's Gold Horus name, ""Ennebu""."
